# Welcome To

This project is the coded front end of the board game Welcome To.

It is written in Java on a package in Visual Studio Code. 

The code uses front end development abilities to add and display certain images and text.

# Installation

Install Visual Studio Code, download Java, and create a Java Package inside VS Code. Now insert the code file into your package. Keep all the images and folders saved in your files and make sure that the names match what's in the code so they can be found and displayed.

# Project Status

The project opens a window and displays the cards and boards for the game, allowing you to click through the cards and add marks to your board.  

I want to better organize the way the window is presented as well as go more in-depth and actually code the working game instead of just the front end.
